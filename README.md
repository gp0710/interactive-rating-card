## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned
This project was a great opportunity to reinforce my knowledge of DOM manipulation. I was able to practice selecting elements, and adding and removing classes.

### Continued development
Clean up the CSS code, and to convert to SASS.

### Useful resources
- [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_remove_class.asp) - This is a practical explanation and demonstration for adding and removing classes.


## Acknowledgments
- [Yona Appletree](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69621651/how-to-remove-a-class-when-another-element-is-clicked) - This changed my life. I was struggling to add and remove the active class for when a rating is clicked. The solution was so simple, and no for loop was needed! (Well I used .forEach()...)
